# Neural_Style_Transfer
Implementation of Neural Style Transfer

# Requirements:
Tensorflow

scipy

numpy

matplotlib

# Description
USing the VGG16 architecture which has 16 convolutional neural network we utilize transfer learning for neural style task. neural style transfer learning is an architecture that takes into account a pretrained model and reshapes its output by trying to combined the style of an art and the content of another picture allowing the model to generate a new type of picture.
